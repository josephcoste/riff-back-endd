## Project Overview

Riff serves as a dedicated space for artists to connect, collaborate, and innovate. By harnessing the power of collective creativity, Riff empowers users to explore diverse perspectives and create compelling art together.


Riff is a platform designed to facilitate collaboration among artists and enable crowd-sourced art creation. With Riff, users can engage in a dynamic creative process, contributing to and enhancing each other's work through threaded comments associated with individual posts.

## Features

- Collaborative Posting: Users can create posts and others artists can contribute, fostering a collaborative environment for artistic expression.
- Threaded Comments: Each post supports threaded comments, allowing users to provide feedback, suggestions, and additions to specific aspects of the artwork.
- Version Control: Riff enables users to explore multiple iterations of a piece of art, facilitating iterative refinement and evolution of creative ideas.
